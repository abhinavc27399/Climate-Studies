# Climate Studies

This Python project is focused on analyzing and studying climate data. It provides tools and scripts for data processing, visualization, and modeling to support climate research.

## Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Climate data analysis and visualization
- Statistical modeling and forecasting
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Climate-Studies.git
    cd Climate-Studies
    ```
    
2. **Create virtual environment:**
    ```
    python -m venev env
    ```
    
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```
    For Linux/macOS:
        source env/bin/activate
    For Windows:
        env\Scripts\activate 
    ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the scripts:**
    ```
    Using bash:
      1.Make it executable:
          chmod +x run.sh
      2.Run it:
          ./run.sh
    using powershell or command prompt:
          powershell -File run.ps1
        or,
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run.ps1
    ```
